# Motivations

We are developing CurrentsDiscovery as an interactive tool to use scientific measurements from the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound to teach students about the basics of tides. The main questions we hope to address are:

* What causes tides?
* How does that manifest into water level in the Strait, and Puget Sound?
* What happens underneath the surface (i.e., how are tidal elevations and currents related)?

The tasks associated with this questions involve:

* Develop text and images to describe how tides are related to the position of the moon
* Develop text and interactive plots to show how tides propogate into the Strait of Juan de Fuca
* Develop text and interactive plots to show the relation of currents to tidal elevations

## Below are the use cases we anticipate for our 

### Use Case 0: Data Preparation
* Data Preparation
* Download Data for NOAA tidal stations and ADCP data
* Quality control the data
* Identify what tidal and current data

### Use Case 1/Module 1: Background about Tides
* Mostly background and intro to where tides come from
* Interactive plot showing tidal buldge and the Earth moving underneath the moon. 


### Use Case 2/Moduel 2: Tides and Elevation in the Straight of Juan de Fuca
* Show tidal elevations from several 
* Map of station locations: Neah Bay, Port Angeles, Port Townsend
* Generate surface tilt plot of the tide cycle/elevation at each of the stations
* User-slider in time to show how the tidal cycle at each changes changes the elevation between stations
* Ask user to think about what the tilt means and how water is going to flow

### Use Case 3/Module 3: Current Connection to Tides
* Introduce currents + tides with a figure/illustration
* Zero in on Port Townsend with the tidal elevations
* Show ferry-measured currents
* Allow the user to move through time to see the evolution of the currents with the tidal elevation
